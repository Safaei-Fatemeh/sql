**Write**: Reflect on your previous work and how you would adjust to include ethics and inequity components. Total length should be a few paragraphs, no more than one page.

In my work with the Enbridge Gas company datasets, I focused on analyzing data and predicting future pipeline failures. However, looking back, I realize that ethics, privacy, and equity should also have been considered more carefully.

First, the dataset contained sensitive information about the locations of failures and the personnel responsible. To protect privacy, I would ensure that personal data is anonymized and that access to sensitive information is limited. This would prevent misuse and help keep the data secure.

Second, the location data could raise equity issues. If repair efforts are based solely on the data, some communities, especially lower-income ones, might be overlooked. In future projects, I would make sure that decisions are fair and take all areas into account equally.

Lastly, the data included personnel involved in pipeline failures. It is important to understand that failures can be caused by larger system issues, not just individual errors. I would use this data to help improve training and resources for employees, rather than focusing on assigning blame.
So, by adding ethical considerations such as privacy protection, fairness, and recognizing the human factors behind the data, my work would be more responsible and equitable for everyone involved.
