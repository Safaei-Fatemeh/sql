# Assignment 1: Design a Logical Model

## Question 1
Create a logical model for a small bookstore. ðŸ“š

At the minimum it should have employee, order, sales, customer, and book entities (tables). Determine sensible column and table design based on what you know about these concepts. Keep it simple, but work out sensible relationships to keep tables reasonably sized. Include a date table. There are several tools online you can use, I'd recommend [_Draw.io_](https://www.drawio.com/) or [_LucidChart_](https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/).

## Question 2
We want to create employee shifts, splitting up the day into morning and evening. Add this to the ERD.

## Question 3
The store wants to keep customer addresses. Propose two architectures for the CUSTOMER_ADDRESS table, one that will retain changes, and another that will overwrite. Which is type 1, which is type 2?

_Hint, search type 1 vs type 2 slowly changing dimensions._

Bonus: Are there privacy implications to this, why or why not?
```
There are two approaches to managing customer addresses: one that overwrites the address when it changes (Type 1) and one that retains historical address information (Type 2). I uploaded two graphs for these two types. 

Type 1 SCD (Overwriting Changes)
In this approach, when a customer's address changes, the old address is overwritten by the new one. This means that the database will only store the current address, and previous addresses will not be kept.

Type 2 SCD (Retaining Changes)
In this approach, each time a customer's address changes, a new record is added to the Customer Address table, keeping the old address as part of the history. The table uses start_date and end_date fields to record when the address was active.
```

## Question 4
Review the AdventureWorks Schema [here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/LMu4W.gif)

Highlight at least two differences between it and your ERD. Would you change anything in yours?
```
This schema is highly normalized and involves many tables for different business operations, such as sales, production, purchasing, and human resources. It also includes schemas for different departments like Sales, Purchasing, and Production, reflecting the larger scale and complexity of operations. But, my ERD is more streamlined with fewer tables. I have basic entities such as Customer, Order, Sales, and Book, and my relationships are straightforward and suitable for managing a small bookstore.
My design doesnâ€™t need schemas for human resources or production, as these are not relevant to a small bookstore.
